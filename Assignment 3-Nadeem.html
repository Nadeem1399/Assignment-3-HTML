<h1>My top three favourite things</h1>

  <li>Family/friends time</li>

  <li>Video games</li>

<h2>Family/Friends time</h2> 
<p>Spending time with family and friends is my most favourite thing to do. This is because I love making personal connections with them and doing different activities that we enjoy. Activities such as watching a movie, going out to play bowling, or pool, card/board games, and much more. We like to catch up on each others lives and see if everyone is doing well and if they need help with something we are supportive to each other. </p>
<h3>Basketball</h3>
<p>My next favourite thing to do is basketball. I love the game of basketball and have been playing since I was young in elementary school. It is a fast-paced game and requires teamwork, agility, making the correct plays, shooting with the proper aim and form, and most importantly defense. I like working on my game and learning better ways to improve my layups, my shooting form, defense and, much more. I like playing 5 vs 5 full court games, as it requires the most skill and harder competition improves my skills greatly. </p>
<h4>Video games</h4> 
<p>My third favourite thing to do is playing video games. The gaming industry is evolving every year, and I have been gaming since I got my very first gaming console, which was a Nintendo Game Cube. Then after that I got a PS2 when it came out a long time ago. The games in the past were classics, they didn’t have realistic graphics but were story driven and very fun to play. Classics such as Mario, Pac-Man, legend of Zelda, and many more. Now I have a PS5, and I love the single player story games but also like playing multiplayer games with my friends such as Apex legends and Fortnite. </p>
